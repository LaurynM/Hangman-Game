# Pianoman

### Sing us a song, you're the piano man!

In Pianoman, it's up to you to tickle the ivories and delight the crowd. Figure out which music term is displayed on your piano by typing the letters you want to guess. But, don't play too many wrong notes or you'll lose the crowd! How many encores can *you* perform?


### Description: 

This hangman-style game uses JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5 to register users' keystrokes and compare them to a randomly chosen word. The user will have a certain number of attempts, based on the length of the word. Wins and losses are tracked and displayed to the user. New games start automatically after each win or loss.
